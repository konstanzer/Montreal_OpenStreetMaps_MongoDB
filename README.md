<h2 id="overview">Map Area</h2>

I chose Montreal as my area of interest because it was a favorite place to visit while growing up in New York. It's a place of good memories and I would like its [OpenStreetMap][1] data to be improved in quality. It's also an opportunity to learn some French. For the wrangling, I downloaded the osm file from [Mapzen][2], a site that provides OpenStreetMap data for many major cities.

Montreal is the largest city in the Canadian province of Quebec and the second-largest in Canada. French is the city's official language. The city consists of most of the Island of Montreal as well as a few smaller peripheral islands but there is considerable confusion regarding [which municipalities constitute the City of Montreal Proper][3]. In 2002, all of the Island of Montreal was merged into the city of Montreal, only for some municipalities to later return to independent cities. In 2011, Montreal proper had a population of 1,649,519 while Greater Montreal had a population of 3,824,221. [[1](#wiki)]

 The cutouts above exclude from the dataset Mont-Royal, Westmount, Hampstead, East Montreal, and most of the island west of Saint Laurent.
